# Electric Vehicle Savings Calculator

This repository contains the source code for the [Electric Vehicle Savings Calculator](https://pchwasta.github.io/electric-vehicle-savings/). The tool helps users estimate potential savings when switching from a gasoline-powered vehicle to an electric vehicle (EV). By inputting key information like fuel cost, fuel efficiency, and driving habits, the calculator provides insights into fuel savings and the payback period for an EV purchase.
